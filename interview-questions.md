# ASSESSMENT 1: Tech Interview Practice Questions
Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. What is git? What is the difference between git and Github?

  Your answer:
Git is a way to save code that is being worked on by one or more parties. GitHub is the online cloud where the information can be accessed, stored, and saved.

  Researched answer:
 Global Information Tracker, also known as Git, is what is called a version control system. Version control systems are important for programmers because they are able to track and log changes made on files and they also give one the ability to restore or review earlier versions of said file. Git is a vcs that is located and operates on your computer.  
  GitHub is different because it's an online Git repository hosting service. It allows users to make and store Git repositories online so that others may access them to work on, edit, etc.

2. What types of evaluations will return a Boolean value?

  Your answer:
    Types of evaluations that will return Boolean values are things like is 6 > 8 or does 7 === 7 and things like that. Basically anything that returns a true or false statement, returns a Boolean value.

  Researched answer:
   Boolean expressions compare one value with another value and return a true or false statement. Some evaluations that return Boolean values contain operators such as !== (not equal to), === (equal to), and the operators <,>, <=, >=, which translate to greater than or less than, and greater than or equal to, or less than or equal to.


3. What is an index? What is the difference between index and value?

  Your answer:
    An index is a number that tells where in a string or an array that a value or character is located. In dealing with computers, the index always starts at zero, meaning the first character or value will be at the index of 1.
      The difference between index and value is that index is where the value is located, where as value, can be a number or letter in a string or an array.

  Researched answer:
An index is used as a reference to the actual location of an element in an array. Since computers are "zero-indexing", the first index location will always be a zero. Values, are what defines the actual element being held in said index. The difference between index and value is that index is a location of an element in an array or string, where as the value is what the element is in the specified location or index.  


4. What is iteration?

  Your answer:
  Iteration is repeating a certain command a certain amount of times until a desired answer is returned. It is used in loops.

  Researched answer:
By definition iteration is defined as the repition of a process or utterance. In terms of Javascript, iteration is the act of performing a set of logical commands a number of times. In loops, iteration allows programs to execute a function a number of times using different sets of inputs each time.


5. Give a brief description of proper pair programming techniques. What are the roles of each person?

  Your answer:
  Proper pair programming techniques include clear communication, engagement, sharing of the workload, helping your partner/partner(s) with problem solving, and having an understanding that you may know a little more or a little less than your partner, and that's ok.  Proper pair programming requires effort from all parties whether they're driving or navigating. I also think for proper pair programming, there is a level of humility that should be shown so that noone feels discouraged or feels like they're not as smart, or don't know as much as their partners.

  As far as roles for each person, there is a driver and a navigator. A driver is the programmer who is doing the coding and sharing their screen. The navigator is giving some instructions to the driver, observing, and helping anyway they can while working together. Another proper pair programming technique is the driver and navigator switching off every so often.

  Researched answer:
Pair programming is when two programmers are working on a single system. One programmer, the "driver",will be driving, which means they're typing or coding. The other programmer is known as the "navigator", and they are observing, continually revising, as well as concentrating on the plan of action.

Proper pair programming techniques include keeping in closer touch with each other, allowing each other to participate, and keep each other on task. Also, holding each other accountable and helping out when the other person is stuck is important. Some others not mentioned yet are preparing for the session, learn and facilitate learning, and getting into a rhythm.


6. What is something we did in class this week you found helpful?  

  Your answer:

  There was really a lot we did in class this first week I found helpful, but I think the thing I found most helpful was the pair programming. I really wasn't sure what it would be like when it was explained to me how it works prior to the class starting, but I have really enjoyed it. It's given me an opportunity to get to know the classmates I've had the pleasure of working with so far, a little better, which ultimately makes the class more enjoyable and a better learning environment. It also provides me a chance to learn more if my partner has more experience as well as a chance for me to help others learn, which in turn, helps me have a better understanding of what we're doing.



## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.

1. GitHub pull request:

GitHub pull requests are a way to show others the changes you've made to a certain branch in a GitHub repository. It allows someone to review the changes and give feedback if something needs to be fixed or if it's okay to be merged with the main branch. An example is when we finish our challenges for a topic in class and push our files to our branch, we submit a pull request so that Austin or Sarah can review them before merging them to the main branch.

2. Higher Order Functions:
Higher-order functions are functions that operate on or change other functions.  After reading through a little bit in Eloquent Javascript, I found that a good use or higher-order functions is to keep code to a minimum in a way, to create less confusion, ultimately reducing the chances of creating bugs.


3. Jest:
Jest is used to test correctness of JavaScript code.

4. Objects:
An object in JavaScript is an entity that contains properties that define their characteristics.

5. Classes:
Classes in JavaScript are templates or blueprints for JavaScript objects.
